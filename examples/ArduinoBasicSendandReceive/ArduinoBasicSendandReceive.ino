/**
 * This sketch sends a "Reflected Hello World!" message via the RB9704, then attempts
 * to read it when it gets sent back to the device.
 * 
 * A serial connection (on Serial1) will first be attempted, if successful a request to
 * que the message will be issued (note: this will fail if the RB9704 is not provisioned
 * for the specified topic and will block until the message is fully transferred, this might
 * take a while if the signal is poor). Once the message is sent the script will display
 * any change in signal and listen for the message to be reflected back, once the message
 * has been received an attempt to shutdown the serial connection will be made.
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * RB9704 needs to be provisioned for messaging topic 80 (reflector).
 * RB9704 needs to be wired to the TX and RX pins of Serial1.
 * Have an open view of the sky where a good signal can be obtained.
